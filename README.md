# React JSON-Based Website

The website is designed to be modular and dynamic. The user's name and project details are stored in a JSON file, making it simple to update and maintain. This approach minimizes code changes and streamlines the process of customizing the site.

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to create your own personalized website by copying and customizing this project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. 
- npm (comes with Node.js) as your package manager.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eirbja/eirbja.github.io.git
    ```

2. **Remove the .git Folder**
    ```bash
    cd SOURCE-REPO
    rm -rf .git
    ```

3. **Create new GitHub Repository**

    1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
    2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right and select **"New repository"**.
    3. Enter **username.github.io** as the Repository name. (ðŸš¨Remeber to change `username`ðŸš¨) 
    4. Press **Create Repository**.

3. **Create git repository and add files:**

    (ðŸš¨Remeber to change `username`ðŸš¨)

    ```bash
    git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push -u origin main
    ```

5. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

6. **Run the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Updating Content

The website content is driven by a JSON file, making it easy to update your details without touching the React code.

### Example JSON Snippet

```bash
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "projects": [
    {
      "title": "Game console",
      "description": "Verry Game console",
      "image": "/sample_image.jpg",
      "imageH": 380
    },
    {
      "title": "Autonomous Drone",
      "description": "Verry cool Autonomous Drone",
      "image": "N/A",
      "imageH": 300
    }
  ]
}
```

### Important Customization Notes:
- `name`: Should be changed to your name

- `projects`: A list of all the projects you want to display.

    - `title`: The name of the project. For instance

    - `description`: A brief description of the project.

    

    - `image`: The file path or URL to the project's image. Use `"image": "/sample_image.jpg"` to specify an image located in your project directory or provide a full URL for external images. If no image is available, you can use `"image": "N/A"`.

    - `imageH`: The height of the image in pixels.

Make sure to follow the JSON structure when adding or modifying.


## New Files

All new files, such as images or documents, should be added to the `public` folder. This ensures they are accessible to the website and can be referenced in the JSON file or other parts of the project.

ðŸš¨ **Important!** Your cv file has to be called my_CV.svg (and be of the svg format)

New files should have the same references as in the json example [here](#updating-content).

### Example Structure:
```
public/
â”œâ”€â”€ sample_image.jpg      # Example project image
â””â”€â”€ my_CV.svg             # Your CV file
â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
```


## Deploy

### Homepage

In the package.json file, change the to "homepage": "https://username.github.io/". Where again "username" needs to be set to your github username.
